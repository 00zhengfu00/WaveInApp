# Audio Visualization View #

Implementation of [music player concept](https://dribbble.com/shots/2369760-Player-Concept). Welcome Live Equalizer with wave effect. As animation shows, when music plays the waves are active, and once it is paused or stopped â€“ waves calm down.

To include this library to your project add dependency in **build.gradle** file:

```groovy
    dependencies {
        compile 'com.cleveroad:audiovisualization:0.9.0'
    }
```

Setup process can be splitted into few steps.

<br />
#### Preparing AndroidManifest.xml ####
* * *
Audio visualization view uses OpenGL ES 2.0 for drawing waves. So you need to include this line in your manifest:

```XML        
    <uses-feature android:glEsVersion="0x00020000" android:required="true" />
```

All functionality built upon [Visualizer](http://developer.android.com/intl/ru/reference/android/media/audiofx/Visualizer.html) object, so you also need to include this permissions in your manifest:

```XML
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"/>
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS"/>
```

You must be very careful with new [Android M permissions](http://developer.android.com/intl/ru/training/permissions/requesting.html) flow. Make sure you have all necessary permissions before using **GLAudioVisualizationView**.

<br />
#### Including **GLAudioVisualizationView** into layout ####
* * *

There are two ways to include **GLAudioVisualizationView** in your layout: directly in XML layout file or using builder in Java code.

Via XML:

```XML
    <com.cleveroad.audiovisualization.GLAudioVisualizationView
        xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
        xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
        android:id="@+id/visualizer_view"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="match_parent"
        app:bubble_size="@dimen/bubble_size"
        app:randomize_bubble_size="true"
        app:wave_height="@dimen/wave_height"
        app:footer_height="@dimen/footer_height"
        app:waves_count="7"
        app:layers_count="4"
        app:background_color="@color/color_bg"
        />
```

Via Java code:

```JAVA
    new GLAudioVisualizationView.Builder(getContext())
        .setBubbleSize(R.dimen.bubble_size)
        .setRandomizeBubbleSize(true)
        .setWaveHeight(R.dimen.wave_height)
        .setFooterHeight(R.dimen.footer_height)
        .setWavesCount(7)
        .setLayersCount(4)
        .setBackgroundColorRes(R.color.color_bg)
        .setLayerColors(R.array.colors)
        .build();
```
    
<br />
#### Usage of **GLAudioVisualizationView** ####
* * *

**GLAudioVisualizationView** implements **AudioVisualization** interface. If you don't need all [GLSurfaceView](http://developer.android.com/intl/ru/reference/android/opengl/GLSurfaceView.html)'s public methods, you can simply cast your view to **AudioVisualization** interface and use it.

```JAVA
    private AudioVisualization audioVisualization;
    
    ...
    
    @Override
    public void onViewCreated(View view, @Nullable Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onViewCreated(view, savedInstanceState);
        // you can extract AudioVisualization interface for simplifying things
        audioVisualization = (AudioVisualization) glAudioVisualizationView;
    }

...

```

To connect audio visualization view to audio output you can use **linkTo(int)** or **linkTo(MediaPlayer)** methods.

```JAVA
    // connecting to device's output mix
    audioVisualization.linkTo(0);
    ...
    MediaPlayer mp = MediaPlayer.create(...);
    audioVisualization.linkTo(mp);
```

You must always call **onPause** method to pause visualization and stop wasting CPU resources for computations in vain. As soon as your view appears in sight of user, call **onResume**. 

```JAVA
    @Override
    public void onResume() {
        super.onResume();
        audioVisualization.onResume();
    }
    
    @Override
    public void onPause() {
        audioVisualization.onPause();
        super.onPause();
    }
```

When user leaves screen with audio visualization view, don't forget to free resources and call **release()** method.

```JAVA
    @Override
    public void onDestroyView() {
        audioVisualization.release();
        super.onDestroyView();
    }
```
