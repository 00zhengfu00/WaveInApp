## Welcome to Audio Visualization View with wave effect.

Our library can take audio from any source (audio players, streams, voice input) and animate it with high frame rate. Cool animation, designed specially for the library, responds to sound vibrations. The animation becomes intense when music plays, and once it is paused or stopped â€“ waves calm down.

The library is a part of implementation of <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2369760-Player-Concept">music player</a>.

Great visualization can spruce up any app, especially audio player. We suggest you smart and good-looking Audio Visualization View for your Android app. You can read about all the advantages this library has and find out how to implement it into your app in our blog post:

## Setup and usage

To include this library to your project add dependency in **build.gradle** file:

```groovy
    dependencies {
        compile 'com.cleveroad:audiovisualization:0.9.1'
    }
```

Audio visualization view uses OpenGL ES 2.0 for drawing waves. So you need to include this line in your manifest:

```XML        
    <uses-feature android:glEsVersion="0x00020000" android:required="true" />
```

##### Using VisualizerDbmHandler

All functionality of this handler built upon [Visualizer](http://developer.android.com/intl/ru/reference/android/media/audiofx/Visualizer.html) object, so you also need to include this permissions in your manifest:

```XML
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"/>
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS"/>
```

##### Using SpeechRecognizerDbmHandler

All functionality of this handler built upon [SpeechRecognizer](http://developer.android.com/intl/ru/reference/android/speech/SpeechRecognizer.html) object, so you also need to include this permissions in your manifest:

```XML
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"/>
```

You must be very careful with new [Android M permissions](http://developer.android.com/intl/ru/training/permissions/requesting.html) flow. Make sure you have all necessary permissions before using **GLAudioVisualizationView**.

There are two ways to include **GLAudioVisualizationView** in your layout: directly in XML layout file or using builder in Java code.

Via XML:

```XML
    <com.cleveroad.audiovisualization.GLAudioVisualizationView
        xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
        xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
        android:id="@+id/visualizer_view"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="match_parent"
        app:av_bubble_size="@dimen/bubble_size"
        app:av_randomize_bubble_size="true"
        app:av_wave_height="@dimen/wave_height"
        app:av_footer_height="@dimen/footer_height"
        app:av_waves_count="7"
        app:av_layers_count="4"
        app:av_background_color="@color/color_bg"
        />
```

Via Java code:

```JAVA
    new GLAudioVisualizationView.Builder(getContext())
        .setBubbleSize(R.dimen.bubble_size)
        .setRandomizeBubbleSize(true)
        .setWaveHeight(R.dimen.wave_height)
        .setFooterHeight(R.dimen.footer_height)
        .setWavesCount(7)
        .setLayersCount(4)
        .setBackgroundColorRes(R.color.color_bg)
        .setLayerColors(R.array.colors)
        .build();
```

**GLAudioVisualizationView** implements **AudioVisualization** interface. If you don't need all [GLSurfaceView](http://developer.android.com/intl/ru/reference/android/opengl/GLSurfaceView.html)'s public methods, you can simply cast your view to **AudioVisualization** interface and use it.

```JAVA
    private AudioVisualization audioVisualization;
    
    ...
    
    @Override
    public void onViewCreated(View view, @Nullable Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onViewCreated(view, savedInstanceState);
        // you can extract AudioVisualization interface for simplifying things
        audioVisualization = (AudioVisualization) glAudioVisualizationView;
    }

    ...
```

To connect audio visualization view to audio output you can use **linkTo(DbmHandler)** method. See **DbmHandler.Factory** class for the list of available handler implementations.

```JAVA
    SpeechRecognizerDbmHandler handler = DbmHandler.Factory.newSpeechRecognizerHandler(context);
    handler.innerRecognitionListener(...);
    audioVisualization.linkTo(handler);
```

You must always call **onPause** method to pause visualization and stop wasting CPU resources for computations in vain. As soon as your view appears in sight of user, call **onResume**. 

```JAVA
    @Override
    public void onResume() {
        super.onResume();
        audioVisualization.onResume();
    }
    
    @Override
    public void onPause() {
        audioVisualization.onPause();
        super.onPause();
    }
```

When user leaves screen with audio visualization view, don't forget to free resources and call **release()** method.

```JAVA
    @Override
    public void onDestroyView() {
        audioVisualization.release();
        super.onDestroyView();
    }
```

<br/>
## Implementing your own DbmHandler

To implement you own data conversion handler, just extend your class from DbmHandler class and implement **onDataReceivedImpl(T object, int layersCount, float[] outDbmValues, float[] outAmpValues)** method where:
* `object` - your custom data type
* `layersCount` - count of layers you passed in **Builder**.
* `outDbmValues` - array with size equals to `layersCount`. You should fill it with **normalized** dBm values for layer in range [0..1].
* `outAmpValues` - array with size equals to `layersCount`. You should fill it with amplitude values for layer.
Check JavaDoc of this method for more info.

Then call **onDataReceived(T object)** method to visualize your data.

Your handler also will receive **onResume()**, **onPause()** and **release()** events from audio visualization view.

## Changelog

| Version | Changes                         |
| --- | --- |
| v.0.9.1 | Added ability to set custom dBm handler implementations; implemented SpeechRecognizerDbmHandler |
| v.0.9.0 | First public release            |

#### Migrations from v.0.9.0 to v.0.9.1
* All library resources and attributes were renamed, prefix `av_` was added. If you're adding Audio Visualization view through XML, make sure you'd properly renamed all attributes. See updated example above. 
* All library resources were marked as private. If you're pointing to any library resource (color, dimen, etc), Android Studio will warn you.
* All calculations of dBm values were moved to separate classes. Now you should use **DbmHandler.Factory** class to create new handlers and link it to audio visualization view using **linkTo(DbmHandler)** method. You can provide your implementation of DbmHandler as well.
* **setInnerOnPreparedListener()** and **setInnerOnCompletionListener()** methods moved to new **VisualizerDbmHandler** class.
